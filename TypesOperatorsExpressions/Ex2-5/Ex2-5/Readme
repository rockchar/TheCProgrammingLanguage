Exercise 2-5.
Write the function any(s1,s2), which returns the first location in the string s1 where any character from the string s2 occurs, or âˆ’1 if s1 contains no characters from s2. (The standard library function strpbrk does the same job but returns a pointer to the location.)

NOTES:
The diference is the STACK memory used.

For example when programming for microcontrollers where very little memory for the stack is allocated, makes a big difference.

char a[] = "string"; // the compiler puts {'s','t','r','i','n','g', 0} onto STACK

char *a = "string"; // the compiler puts just the pointer onto STACK
                    // and {'s','t','r','i','n','g',0} in static memory area.
