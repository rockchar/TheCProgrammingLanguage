Exercise 2-1:
Write a program to determine the ranges of char,short,int and long variables
The ranges should be for both signed and unsigned types
The values can be printed by checking the appropriate values from standard headers
The values can be printed by direct computation

HINT: header files limits.h and float.h contain the symbolic constants for the sizes
